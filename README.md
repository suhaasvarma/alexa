A really simple way to build an Alexa skill for your start up.

Amazon alexa is a virtual assistant developed by Amazon.

I'll try to put everything in laymen's. *Cause I started being Laymen*

Step 1:  Open https://developer.amazon.com
Step 2:  Click on Alexa.
Step 3:  In the top right corner click on "Your Alexa Consoles" and select "Skills".
Step 4:  Now Click on Create Skill and enter skill name leaving model to "Custom" and click create skill.
Step 5:  Choose start from Scratch and you are ready with your console now.

The set up process is now done.

Step 6:  Select invocation and give a name where you like alexa to respond and start your alexa skill.
Step 7:  In the left drop down menu, you can find intents. Press the + button to add intents
Step 8:  Enter the name of intent(intent is the root name for different questions which map to same answer. In my case i give                  intent name as "GetOpenTime" and the questions would be "At what time do you open","What is the opening time", etc.) now enter all the questions under "Sample Utterances" as per mentioned above.
Step 9:  Repeat Step 7 and Step 8 for the number of types of queries.
